# Retty Does AoC

Here is my probably-awful attempt at Advent of Code 2024.

I don't normally do this sort of thing, but I'm getting *rusty* (heh) - my programming skills have really fallen off in the last few years. I'm a lazy Python scripter with a severe lack of bravery when it comes to trying new stuff.

I've been moaning about all the overhyping of Rust for months now, but if you can't beat 'em, join 'em.
